# BayesiaLab â€” Education Package

### Context&#x20;

* The BayesiaLab Education Package is specifically configured for classroom use and includes student and teacher licenses.

### License Definition

* The BayesiaLab Education Package includes:
  * One Single-User/Single-Machine License for instructor use:
    * Equivalent to the [BayesiaLab Academic Edition](bayesialab-academic-edition.md).
    * The BayesiaLab software is installed locally on the instructor's computer.
    * The instructor license is subject to the same installation and transfer restrictions as the commercial [Single-User/Single-Machine License](bayesialab-professional-single-user-single-machine-license.md).
  * Floating Token Licenses for Students:&#x20;
    * A restricted version of the BayesiaLab software is installed locally on students' computers.
    * The student restriction limits BayesiaLab to using a maximum of 50 variables and 1,000 records. Otherwise, its functionality is identical to [BayesiaLab Professional Floating Token License](bayesialab-professional-floating-token-license.md).
    * Students can install the BayesiaLab software on multiple computers.
    * The number of licensed Floating Token Licenses determines the maximum number of concurrent student sessions. For example, to allow 30 students to work simultaneously with BayesiaLab during a class, you will need to license at least 30 Floating Token Licenses.
    * There is no limitation regarding the number of student users and the number of local BayesiaLab installations. As a result, the number of student users and installations can exceed the number of Floating Token Licenses.
    * BayesiaLab can be installed on all computers in a lab, on virtual machines, on students' laptops, on home computers, etc.
    * An Internet connection to the Global Bayesia License Server is required whenever a student runs a BayesiaLab session.
  * By default, the instructor can manage the student licenses via a web-based management console (see Bayesia License Server Account Management).
