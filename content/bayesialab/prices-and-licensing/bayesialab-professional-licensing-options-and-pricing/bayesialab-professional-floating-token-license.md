# BayesiaLab Professional — Floating Token License

### Context

* As an alternative to a [Single-User/Single-Machine License](bayesialab-professional-single-user-single-machine-license.md), a Floating Token License can be shared between multiple users within an organization.

### Product Definition&#x20;

* With a Floating Token License, the BayesiaLab software is installed locally on each user’s computer.
* BayesiaLab needs to be connected to a [Bayesia License Server](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/bayesia-license-server) while users run a BayesiaLab session or before they check out (“borrow”) a license for offline use, e.g., prior to air travel.&#x20;
* The number of purchased or rented Floating Token Licenses determines the maximum number of concurrent user sessions.
* For instance, if your company rents three tokens, you can have a maximum of three concurrent user sessions.
* There is no restriction regarding the number of installations, so dozens or even hundreds of users can have BayesiaLab installed locally and ready to launch whenever needed.
* Users can have multiple copies of BayesiaLab installed, e.g., on their desktop, laptop, including virtual machines, and even Windows tablet computers.
* Account Managers can add/delete end-users and manage their access via a web-based Account Management Panel (see Bayesia License Server — Account Management).

### Versions

* A Floating Token License is available in two versions:
  * A Worldwide Floating Token License without any geographical restrictions.
