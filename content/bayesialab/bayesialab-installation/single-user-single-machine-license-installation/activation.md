# Activation

* After starting BayesiaLab for the first time, you will be prompted for your Client Identifier (or Client ID).&#x20;
* The Client Identifier in the format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX was provided to you in the [Account Information](account-information.md) email.

* Enter the Client Identifier and click OK.
* You have the choice of [Automatic Activation](activation.md#automatic-activation) or [Manual Activation](activation.md#manual-activation).
* For most users, the [Automatic Activation](activation.md#automatic-activation) will be simpler, but certain network configurations, e.g., with corporate firewalls, may prevent this process. In that case, [Manual Activation](activation.md#manual-activation) becomes necessary.

* Check the "Automatic process" box and click OK to proceed.
* BayesiaLab now communicates with the Bayesia License Server to validate your license.\

### Manual Activation

* In case the [Automatic Activation](activation.md#automatic-activation) is not possible, e.g., if your computer is not directly connected to the Internet for security reasons, check the box for Manual process and click OK.

The next screen prompts you to perform the Manual Activation via the Bayesia License Server.

The window provides several important pieces of information:

* The URL of the Bayesia License Server activation page: [https://bls1.bayesia.com/activation](https://bls1.bayesia.com/activation)
* The Client Identifier, which you have already received in your [Account Information](account-information.md) email, is repeated here for your reference.
* The Product Code, which is new to you.
* The Activation Key field, which is still empty and which you do not yet have.

* Copy the Client Identifier, the Product Code, and leave this window open. You need to return to it once you have obtained the Activation Key.
* Go to any computer that has an Internet connection â€” a tablet or smartphone will suffice, and open this page in a browser:  [https://bls1.bayesia.com/activation](https://bls1.bayesia.com/activation)
* On this page, enter the Client Identifier.&#x20;
* Enter the Product Code (from the still-open window on the computer where you are installing BayesiaLab)&#x20;
* Retrieve the Activation Password from the [Account Information](account-information.md) email.
* Click Activate.

* Click OK to start BayesiaLab.

### Periodic License Reactivation

* A Single-User/Single-Machine License must be activated/reactivated once per license term, typically once a year.
* For most users, this means clicking OK when the [Automatic Activation](activation.md#automatic-activation) prompt comes up at the beginning of a new license term.
