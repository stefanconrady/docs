# WebSimulator Administration

### Overview&#x20;

* The WebSimulator Administration Page is your interface to the BayesiaLab WebSimulator Server, which is physically hosted on the premises of Bayesia S.A.S.
* On the Administration Page, you can publish a WebSimulator that you designed and configured in BayesiaLab through the [WebSimulator Editor](../websimulator-editor/).

### Credentials&#x20;

* Enter your Username and Password and click Login.
* Your Username and Password are the same as the credentials that you use to log in to the [Bayesia License Server (BLS)](../../bayesia-license-server-bls/).
* If you are a user of a [Single-User/Single-Machine License (SUSM)](../../bayesialab-installation/single-user-single-machine-license-installation/), you may not yet have credentials to access BLS.
* In that case, you need to use your Client Identifier (format: AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD) to sign in to the Bayesia License Server and register. Please follow the steps explained on the [BLS Login](../../bayesia-license-server-bls/bls-login.md) page.

### Multiple Accounts&#x20;

* If your organization has multiple accounts with Bayesia, you need to ensure that the account you use has the appropriate privileges for publishing public or private models.

### Change Account & Logout&#x20;

* Clicking the Account icon ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184059/BayesiaLab\_Icons/user\_oesqms.svg) in the upper right corner of the Administration Page brings up a drop-down menu that allows you to:
  * Change Account ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184205/BayesiaLab\_Icons/exchange\_ldftlk.svg), i.e., select another account associated with your organization.
  * Log Out ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184218/BayesiaLab\_Icons/sign-out\_nat66y.svg) from the Administration Page.

### Publish Your Model&#x20;

* These subsections explain the core processes of uploading, publishing, and managing your previously configured Bayesian network model.
* Although they are both very similar, we present the workflows for WebSimulator and Adaptive Questionnaire separately for clarity in terminology:
  * Publishing a WebSimulator
  * Publishing an Adaptive Questionnaire
* Either workflow concludes the publication process and makes your model available for use by the intended audience.
* You may wish to refer your audience to the end-user guides:
  * Using the WebSimulator
  * Using the Adaptive Questionnaire
