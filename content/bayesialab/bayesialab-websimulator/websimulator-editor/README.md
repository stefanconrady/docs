# WebSimulator Editor

### Context & Overview&#x20;

* The process of publishing an existing Bayesian network model starts with the WebSimulator Editor in BayesiaLab.
* The WebSimulator Editor allows you to configure the to-be-published model within BayesiaLab.
* Once you save these settings with your Bayesian network file, you can upload and publish it via the [WebSimulator Administration Page](../websimulator-administration/).

### WebSimulator Editor Guide â€” Preparing Your Model&#x20;

* In BayesiaLab, you open the WebSimulator Editor by selecting `Main Menu > Tools > WebSimulator Editor`.
* The WebSimulator Editor is available both in the [Modeling Mode](../../user-guide/main-menu/view/modeling-mode.md) and the [Validation Mode](../../user-guide/main-menu/view/validation-mode.md).
* To configure a WebSimulator or an Adaptive Questionnaire, you need to go through each tab of the WebSimulator Editor as described in the following sections:
  1. [Simulator](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/websimulator-editor-simulator-settings), to define the general settings of the WebSimulator.
  2. [Inputs](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/websimulator-editor-inputs) to define the interface for end-user input.
  3. [Outputs](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/websimulator-editor-outputs) specify how the outputs will be shown to the end-user.
* The configurations of each tab are automatically associated with your Bayesian network model.
* As you save your model, these settings are automatically recorded in the same XBL file.
  * Whenever you reopen your Bayesian network model, you can return to the WebSimulator settings and modify them as necessary.&#x20;
  * BayesiaLab indicates the presence of a WebSimulator configuration with the WebSimulator indicator icon ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184073/BayesiaLab\_Icons/simulator\_z7bc5i.svg) in the bottom-right corner of the main window.
* Once you have saved your fully configured model as an XBL file, you can leave BayesiaLab and proceed to the WebSimulator Administration Page to upload and publish your model.
