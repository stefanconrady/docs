# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Introducing BayesiaLab's New Native ChatGPT Integration for Domain Knowledge Augmentation

Presented at the [2023 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./).

### Abstract

Knowledge Elicitation has been a central research topic for the BayesiaLab team for many years, so the arrival of ChatGPT last year has prompted us to leverage its innovative technology immediately with BayesiaLab.

{% endhint %}

In this presentation, we will show new functions that directly integrate ChatGPT into BayesiaLab, including:

* Chat Completion
* Image Generation
* Embedding Generation

BayesiaLab's forthcoming Subject Matter Assistant, to be released in Version 11, can improve research workflows in several ways:

* Accelerate the qualitative part of knowledge elicitation.
* Generate practical natural language descriptions for latent factors created through BayesiaLab's [clustering functions](https://www.bayesia.com/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/learning-clustering).
* Automatically create images to illustrate nodes in a network.
