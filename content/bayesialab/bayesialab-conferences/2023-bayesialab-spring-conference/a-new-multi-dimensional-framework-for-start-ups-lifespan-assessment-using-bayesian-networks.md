# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡· A New Multi-Dimensional Framework for Start-Ups Lifespan Assessment Using Bayesian Networksâ€‹

Presented at the [2023 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./).

### Abstract

Assessing risk for a start-up is always a complex and challenging task, as historical data is typically unavailable. Traditional methods are inadequate in capturing the full complexity, so more sophisticated tools are required. This paper presents a method for estimating the default rate at various stages of a start-up's life cycle using an expert-elicited Bayesian Networks (BNs) methodology. A prototype BN model is proposed to combine diverse sources of information, including historical data and expert knowledge. The model has a hierarchical structure to capture start-ups' known risk factors. It also uses the Noisy-OR operator to capture the unknown risks in each of the main categories.

The prototype model can be adjusted to capture the unique characteristics of each start-up and investor. 3 case studies were used to demonstrate the applicability of the model. The proposed method reduces the cognitive error of experts, takes advantage of the learning feature of BNs when updating default estimations, and takes into account the impact of investors' risk appetite. It also allows for ranking the most effective risk factors at various stages of the start-up life cycle.
