Presented at the [2023 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./).

### Abstract&#x20;

In this presentation, we explore how BayesiaLab can work to identify trends in the DOTâ€™s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrationâ€™s public incident and annual report data to identify strategies that pipeline operators can leverage to reduce incidents and predict failures more effectively.
