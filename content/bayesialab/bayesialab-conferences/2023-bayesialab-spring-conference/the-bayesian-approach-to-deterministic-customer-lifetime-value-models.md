# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ The Bayesian Approach to Deterministic Customer Lifetime Value Models

Presented at the [2023 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./).

### Abstract

Identified factors that drive customer lifetime value and components that drive higher CLV to drive revenue and improve customer retention. Using data from this study, we determine the strength of the relationship between Opportunity, Lifetime Value, and Customer Ratings. Graphs, causal insights, and early warning signals are generated through network analysis. As a result, strategies are better planned, and gaps are identified and addressed more efficiently. Surveys are conducted regularly to understand how to serve our most valuable customers better. By improving customer experience (CX), we are able to increase their lifetime value (LTV). This method also enables us to make precise recommendations about how to improve Client Economics. The Bayesian implementation offers some advantages, which help in more precision and enhanced flexibility in bringing different data sets together with actionable insights.
