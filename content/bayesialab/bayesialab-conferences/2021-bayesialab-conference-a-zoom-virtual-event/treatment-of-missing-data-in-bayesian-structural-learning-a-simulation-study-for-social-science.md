# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Treatment of Missing Data in Bayesian Structural Learning: A Simulation Study for Social Science

Presented at the [9th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 12, 2021.

### Abstract&#x20;

Bayesian networks allow us to uniquely visualise data and tackle complex interdisciplinary problems. Bayesian networks are based on Bayes' theorem. The premise of this theory is that initial (prior) beliefs can be updated based on new evidence. Part of the appeal of this method is its intuitive nature. The process of updating beliefs, given new information, is common to everyday scenarios. Bayesian networks can be used for variable inference (identifying the value of variables), parameter inference (identifying probabilistic dependencies between variables), and structure learning (understanding associations among variables). Social science is an area with large amounts of complex interdisciplinary data where Bayesian networks may be useful to unravel relationships among variables. However, â€‹the uptake of Bayesian networks in social science is relatively low. Here, we look at how Bayesian networks have been applied to antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial use and explore potential barriers to their use in this field of study. The complex nature of this biosocial phenomenon means that applications are increasingly making use of social science data, e.g., survey data. This type of data is often associated with high levels of missing data. Here, we further consider how this missing data can be addressed for Bayesian network structure learning. We compare a commonly used method in social science, multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), with one specific for Bayesian network learning, structural expectation-maximization (SEM). We simulate multiple incomplete data sets with different missingness mechanisms, numbers of categorical variables, and amounts of missing data. We evaluate and compare the performance of MICE and SEM in capturing the real Bayesian network structure under each condition. We find that applying either method (MICE or SEM) provides better structure recovery than doing nothing, and SEM, in general, outperforms MICE. This finding is robust across missingness mechanisms, the number of variables, and the amount of missing data. This suggests that taking advantage of the additional information provided by network structure during SEM can improve the performance of Bayesian networks for social science and other interdisciplinary analyses.
