# üá∫üá∏ Apply BBN Models to Identify Consumer Persona in High-Dimensional Parameter Space

Presented at the [9th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 13, 2021.

### Abstract

It is a challenge to cluster and segment data in high-dimensional space. Traditional clustering methods relying on distance (e.g., k-means) or density (DBScan) generally fail to identify meaningful clusters in high dimensional space. We investigated clustering methods in high-dimensional space using Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) models, k-means, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), Polytomous variable Latent Class Analysis (PoLCA), and Profile Regression. These methods were used to cluster a set of users and prospective users of Setlist Beauty, which is a digital iPhone App owned by P\&G. There are around 500 variables to describe these users. We found that the BBN model performs very well in high-dimensional clustering. Most importantly, it provides metrics to inform us what variables/questions can differentiate consumers and what answers to these questions characterize a consumer segment. These segments and metrics helped deliver actionable insights for targeted advertisement, acquisition, and App feature improvement, etc.

### About the Presenter

Dr. Yong Zhang leverages Bayesian data and modeling science to develop strategies for product design, manufacturing, storage, and transportation across P\&G to improve consumers‚Äô life quality and drive positive influence on the environment and society. He develops first principle and data science/machine learning methods and tools through Front End Innovation projects to enable and promote the capability across P\&G for breakthrough consumer understanding and product innovation. The methods and tools can be used to extract and integrate information from a variety of data sources to find a ‚ÄúBody of Evidence‚Äù for consumer and product research based on Nonparametric Bayesian statistics and deep learning algorithms.
