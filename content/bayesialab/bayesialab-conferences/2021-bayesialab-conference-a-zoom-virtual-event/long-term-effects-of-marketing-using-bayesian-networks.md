# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Long-Term Effects of Marketing using Bayesian Networks

Presented at the 9th Annual BayesiaLab Conference on October 11, 2021.

### Abstract

Long-term brand marketing is important to achieve sustainable growth. There are many important areas that companies can invest in paid ads, performance marketing, and affiliate marketing. They will all help with growth, but eventually, you will hit that glass ceiling. Plus, with nearly every market oversaturated at this point, we will need to spend a whole lot of money to have any chance of standing out.

In my talk, I demonstrate how Course5 is disrupting the space of Digital Media Optimization with its new solution offering and why it is important for the industry to consider and adopt such solutions in the challenging times we are in.
