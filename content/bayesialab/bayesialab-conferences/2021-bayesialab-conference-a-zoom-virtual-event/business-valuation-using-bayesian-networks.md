# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Business Valuation Using Bayesian Networks

### Abstract

Given wide plausible value ranges, the greatest value that a business valuation expert offers a client may be the ability to persuade others (e.g., judges) to locate their preponderance of probabilities (evidence) across the clientâ€™s interval within the plausible value range. Accomplishing this feat is a function of technical valuation expertise, as well as communication tools and techniques. This presentation explores Bayesian networks as a platform for facilitating the probabilistic estimation, negotiation, and communication of business value.
