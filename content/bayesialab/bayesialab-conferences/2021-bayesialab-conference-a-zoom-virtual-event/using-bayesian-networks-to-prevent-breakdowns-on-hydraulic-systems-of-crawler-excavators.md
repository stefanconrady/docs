# üá´üá∑ Using Bayesian Networks to Prevent Breakdowns on Hydraulic Systems of Crawler Excavators

Presented at the [9th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/2021-bayesialab-conference) on October 13, 2021.

### Abstract&#x20;

In the public works environment, avoiding the breakdowns of construction machines is a major challenge. Indeed, this phenomenon can represent a significant economic cost at three different levels. First, we need to pay for the repair of the machine, which is called the direct cost. Then, a breakdown will eventually lead to a delay in the progress of the work or to the need to rent another machine to replace the one that is unavailable, all this representing the indirect cost. And finally, a breakdown can also affect the lifetime of a machine, and optimizing this lifetime is a priority when handling a fleet of public works equipment.

In order to reduce the number of breakdowns, our goal is to develop a system of predictive maintenance, comparably to what can be used in the industry, using the telematic data that the machines produce.

After testing different ‚Äúdata-driven‚Äù approaches and given the complexity and diversity of the breakdowns that can occur, we decided to focus on one specific component: the hydraulic system of crawler excavators, using an expert-based approach with [BEKEE](../../../bekee/bayesia-expert-knowledge-elicitation-environment-bekee.md) to build a Bayesian network representing the health of a hydraulic system.

I studied for five years (2015-2020) at INSA Rennes (engineering school) in the Department of Applied Mathematics. After an internship (2019) and a one-year work-study contract (2019-2020), I am now working full-time as a data scientist at CHARIER, a public works company operating mainly in the West of France.
