# 🇫🇷 Automatic Generation of Bayesian Network Simulators from Financial Texts

Presented at the [9th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 15, 2021. \


### Abstract <a href="#h2__548840665" id="h2__548840665"></a>

Using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) on millions of texts and optimization, we automatically generate Bayesian Networks centered around financial targets such as the “USA inflation” or “ExxonMobil profits” with strong predictive capabilities. These Bayesian Networks are then loaded into the BayesiaLab simulation tool to enable the testing of various hypotheses on the future evolution of any of the drivers of the specified target. These capabilities can be applied to publicly listed companies, commodities, or macroeconomic indicators.
