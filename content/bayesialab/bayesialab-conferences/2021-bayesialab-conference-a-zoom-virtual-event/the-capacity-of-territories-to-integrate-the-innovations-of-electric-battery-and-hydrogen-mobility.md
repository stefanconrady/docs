### About the Presenter&#x20;

I am Gilles Voiron, a research engineer and Geo Data Scientist, an expert in electric mobility. My job is to carry out studies based on precise data to help and advise businesses and communities in the ecosystem of electric mobility. The studies carried out considering local specifications allow lessons to be learned to propose recommendations for today and to plan the needs in the years to come through geo-prospective models on the horizon 2025-2030-2035.
