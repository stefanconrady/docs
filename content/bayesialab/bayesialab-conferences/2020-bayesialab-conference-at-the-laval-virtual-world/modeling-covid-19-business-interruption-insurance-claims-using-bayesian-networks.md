# üá∫üá∏ Modeling COVID-19 Business Interruption Insurance Claims Using Bayesian Networks

Presented at the [8th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 30, 2020.

### Abstract&#x20;

Governmental ‚Äúlock-downs‚Äù in response to COVID-19 have resulted in huge losses to businesses of all sizes across the United States. As businesses turn to insurers to make them whole, insurers are pushing back, arguing that COVID-19 has not caused the ‚Äúdirect physical loss or damage‚Äù required by their insurance contracts. The result is litigation, with 1,249 federal court cases reported by PennLaw‚Äôs Covid Coverage Litigation Tracker through September 21. With billions of dollars and thousands of bankruptcies in the balance, this presentation uses Bayesian networks to model the probability and magnitude of settlements or verdicts in favor of business plaintiffs in such cases.
