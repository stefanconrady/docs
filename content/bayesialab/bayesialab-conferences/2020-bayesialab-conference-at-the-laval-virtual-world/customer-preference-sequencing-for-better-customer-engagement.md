### Abstract&#x20;

Today, brands are out of sync with customersâ€™ needs and preferences when it comes to personalized marketing. The focus of the talk is to highlight how Course5 is developing a solution leveraging causal discovery framework to develop â€˜Customer Preference Sequencingâ€™ -  a customer genome which can generate hyper-personalized recommendations of Product, Price, Promotion & Messaging & communication to ensure brands engagement with their customers stay relevant with customerâ€™s changing needs & preferences.

In my talk, I demonstrate how Course5 is disrupting the space of hyper-personalization with its new solution offering and why it is important for industry to consider and adopt such solution in challenging times we are in.
