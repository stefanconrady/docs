# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The Role of Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms among Smokers and Physical Pain

Presented at the [8th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 27, 2020.

### Abstract&#x20;

The use of marijuana, tobacco, and opioid analgesics has long been associated with psychological distress and chronic pain. The aim of the study was to identify the effects of internalizing and externalizing psychological symptoms utilizing Bayesian Network models to gain a greater understanding of the interrelationships that may exist between pain, psychological and sociodemographic variables. This study included adults enrolled in Wave 4 (2016-2017) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. The PATH Study is an ongoing, longitudinal cohort study of tobacco use and related health outcomes in the U.S. Participants with data on variables related to cigarette smoking, marijuana use, psychological distress from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAIN-SS), opioid use, and pain levels (n=32,551) comprised the study sample. The GAIN-SS identifies individuals at risk for mental health or substance use disorders and has been used across the 4-point Likert scale asking about past year problems with internalized disorder, externalized disorder, substance use, and crime/violent behaviors (crime/violent behavior items were excluded from the PATH Wave 4 study). Established smoking status was defined as lifetime use of 100 cigarettes whereas non-established use was defined as not reaching the 100 cigarette lifetime use threshold. The analyses included population sample weights which accounted for missing data. We employed an augmented naÃ¯ve Bayes (ABN; Bayesialab 9) supervised learning algorithm to identify the interrelationships between the use of pain medications, smoking status, pain intensity, alcohol and marijuana use, GAIN-SS factors, and select sociodemographic characteristics. The initial Augmented NaÃ¯ve Bayes was cross-validated via the K-folds procedure, with K=10. The final ABN structure was learned and optimized via the minimum description length (MDL) scoring algorithm. The initial MDL score was 732,140.862, representing Entropy (H) = 23.0785 (Standard Deviation: 3.9705), and the final MDL score was 689,686.468, representing Entropy (H) = 21.7285 (Standard Deviation: 3.9812), with mean information compression of 5.7427%. Overall relationship analyses with pain indicated that the internalized behavior factor was the most important predictive variable among these participants suggesting that by knowing pain, we reduce our uncertainty regarding internalized behavior by 2.49% on average. Smoking status, opioid use, and marijuana use were also found to be associated with pain. The severity of internalized, externalized problems and substance use disorders along with current and former established cigarette smoking were associated with high levels of pain intensity, suggesting that self-reported pain is an important factor to consider in smoking cessation and substance abuse counseling programs.

Mahathi Vojjala is a third-year doctoral candidate in the Epidemiology track working with Dr. Raymond Niaura. She is a 2017 MPH graduate from New York University School of Global Public Health (GPH) with a concentration in Epidemiology. Prior to her MPH, Mahathi received a B.A. in religion and public health from Rutgers University. Mahathiâ€™s previous research focused on youth smoking initiation and media advertising, dual and poly use of substances specifically marijuana and cigarettes among young adults, media portrayal of alcohol and tobacco in movie trailers and youth smoking rates, and more recently, use of oral analgesics combined with marijuana, alcohol, and cigarettes among people with chronic pain. Mahathi is primarily interested in assessing the benefits and risks of e-cigarettes by examining metabolic biomarker profiles of tobacco user groups using the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study.&#x20;
