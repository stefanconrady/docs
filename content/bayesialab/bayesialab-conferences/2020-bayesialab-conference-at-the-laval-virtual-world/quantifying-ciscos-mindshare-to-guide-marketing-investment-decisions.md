# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Quantifying Ciscoâ€™s Mindshare to Guide Marketing Investment Decisions

### Abstract&#x20;

As a B2B company, Cisco likes to understand its overall Mindshare as a precursor to eventual market share in specific technology areas it sells into. The type of information that flows into Mindshare tends to be sparse and not frequently collected, and relying on any single measure leads to incorrect conclusions regarding Ciscoâ€™s overall Mindshare. Learn how the team of data scientists and analysts turned to BayesiaLab to unearth the right way to combine this sparse data, as well as glean suggestions for optimization of the underlying measures to increase mindshare and, eventually, market share.
