# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Lessons from Causal Analysis: Policy Implications for Woodland Caribou Recovery in Canada

Presented at the [8th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 26, 2020.

### Abstract&#x20;

As global conservation actions become more urgent, informed decision-making requires robust analyses of the costs and benefits of policy options, based on available evidence. Recovery planning for endangered species must assume a cause-and-effect relationship between proposed management interventions and population responses; however, most current ecological knowledge is derived from observational studies because experiments are largely infeasible or unethical. Weak and conflicting inferences about causal mechanisms have created debate and confusion among decision-makers, planners and stakeholders. While causal modelling techniques are well-developed and common in other policy domains that face similar challenges, the approach is nearly absent in conservation biology. I examine the challenge of woodland caribou recovery efforts in Canada through the lens of causal modelling, highlighting recent, high-profile debates and illustrating how a causal modelling approach can help to bring resolution while supporting robust forecasting and decision support.
