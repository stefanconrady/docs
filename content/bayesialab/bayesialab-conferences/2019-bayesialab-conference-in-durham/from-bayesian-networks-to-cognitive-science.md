# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· From Bayesian Networks to Cognitive Science

Presented at the [7th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

### Abstract&#x20;

At the heart of the companies' information systems, close to decision-makers and operational staff, my professional experiences led me to observe that Business Intelligence (BI) did not provide a satisfactory answer to their real problems. What had changed in 20 years? Rainbow colors on the screens, OLAP cubes democratization, calculation speedâ€¦ exciting â€” and also a nightmare â€” for those in the IT department. But what is the real added value for the decision-makers and the workers? Curious about the potential of AI, I had just been trained in Python, but as a statistician, I saw nothing intellectually satisfying in my discovery of machine learning. Then, a guy talked to me about "Bayesian networks."

That will be the starting point for this talk. An escapade into "augmented intelligence": Bayesian networks and BayesiaLab, encounters, change of relationship to the data, to beliefs, to the world, and to myselfâ€¦ But, who am I, really?
