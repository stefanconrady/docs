# üá∫üá∏ Reasonable Certainty ‚Äî Why Courts Should Use Bayesian Belief Networks to Estimate Economic Damages

Presented at the [7th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

### Abstract&#x20;

In 2010, Robert M. Lloyd wrote, ‚ÄúIn an ideal world, a court would be able to hear the evidence, estimate the plaintiff‚Äôs damages, and quantify its own confidence that the estimate was accurate.‚Äù This presentation argues that Bayesian networks can move the legal world very close to Lloyd‚Äôs ideal. Using an actual court case, this presentation demonstrates how expert witnesses can use Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to estimate economic damages with "reasonable certainty" as required by case law, challenges the mythology that point estimates offer higher certainty than value ranges, and illustrates how courts, arbitrators, and negotiators can use BBNs to "quantify their own confidence" in damages estimates.
