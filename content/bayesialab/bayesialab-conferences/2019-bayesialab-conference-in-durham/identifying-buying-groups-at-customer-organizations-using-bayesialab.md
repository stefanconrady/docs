# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Identifying Buying Groups at Customer Organizations Using BayesiaLab

Presented at the [7th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

### Abstract&#x20;

Large & complex purchases at organizations are often made using input from multiple individuals who would have evaluated the solution from multiple perspectives. Identifying all of these influencers from a given organization becomes critical in ensuring marketing and messaging consistency and providing relevant answers to their questions. The use of BayesiaLab allowed the Marketing Analytics team at Cisco to identify these buying groups amongst its customer organizations and subsequently target them as part of its marketing campaigns to serve them and help accelerate their purchase journeys.
