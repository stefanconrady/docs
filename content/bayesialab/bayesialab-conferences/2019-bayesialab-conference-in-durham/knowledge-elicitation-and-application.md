# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Knowledge Elicitation & Application

Presented at the [7th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

### Abstract&#x20;

The discussion focuses on knowledge elimination in causal modeling, especially transfer learning, and how Course5 uses these concepts to solve complex problems in marketing measurement and optimization. Course5 marketing applications are primarily built around Bayesian Science, leveraging BayesiaLab at various levels in its development. In the specific application of BayesiaLab in its solution â€˜Integrated Marketing Measurement,â€™ I demonstrate how Course5 infers knowledge from one model and transfers it into other related models to handle various challenges in marketing measurement today. The solution is exclusively built leveraging the Bayesian Inference engine from BayesiaLab and will talk about the flexibility and agility of the technology along with the robustness of Bayesian Inference Modeling.
