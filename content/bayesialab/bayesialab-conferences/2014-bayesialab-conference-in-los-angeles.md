# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 2014 BayesiaLab Conference in Los Angeles

## The 2nd Annual BayesiaLab Conference

The 2nd Annual BayesiaLab Conference concluded on September 24. Many thanks to all presenters and participants, some of whom traveled from as far away as India and Australia to join us for this event.

We are particularly grateful to Judea Pearl for his keynote address. It was a tremendous source of inspiration for all attendees.

For those who could not attend in person, we have compiled several presentation videos, slides, and a photo gallery of the event.
