# üáÆüá≥ Market Share and Metrics Association: An Insight into Real-World Data Using Bayesian Networks

To be presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 11, 2024.

### Abstract

This study delves into the effectiveness of an integrated, weighted approach in influencing strategic brand decisions, highlighting the constraints of traditional machine learning and data science techniques that rely heavily on large, clean datasets and struggle with complex variable interrelations. By adopting Bayesian structural equation modeling, our research leverages prior knowledge, expert insights, and beliefs, focusing particularly on how various metrics impact market share. Through primary search surveys across different market segments, we assess brand perception, aggregating data from numerous sources over a set timeframe for comprehensive analysis.

The methodology begins with exploratory data analysis, leading to the testing of probabilistic associations to validate hypotheses and develop the model. An unsupervised network graph forms the core of our model, illustrating the interactions between variables from disparate data sources at a specific time. This base model undergoes scrutiny for statistical robustness and output validation, considering both total and direct effect values to determine weighted coefficients. Further refinement of the network model incorporates business and market inputs, ensuring the model's assumptions align with real-world conditions without undermining its stability. This strategic methodology offers nuanced, actionable insights into a brand's market position, enhancing adaptability and strategic decision-making as new information emerges.
