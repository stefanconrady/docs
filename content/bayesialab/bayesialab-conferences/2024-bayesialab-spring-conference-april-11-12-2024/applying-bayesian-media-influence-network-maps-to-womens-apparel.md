# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Applying Bayesian Media Influence Network Maps to Womenâ€™s Apparel

To be presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 11, 2024.

### Abstract

A Bayesian Media Influence Network solves several problems with a traditional regression-based media marketing mix model. First is the problem of consistent measures across different media types. This is solved by using syndicated survey media and marketing influence measures. Second is the problem of simultaneous consumption and the assumption of independence among predictor variables. Third is the problem of non-linear relationships that may exist between media types and a criterion variable such as sales. A Bayesian Belief Network solves these last two problems and provides an easy-to-understand tool to aid in what has been a traditionally difficult marketing asset allocation decision. Using womenâ€™s apparel as an example, the efficacy of the Bayesian Network for monthly spending is shown, identifying a pattern of media types. Factoring past brand purchase behavior into segments shows how the Bayesian Network can be used to target High-End brands, Accessories, and Active Shoes as examples. Other product categories and target definitions can certainly be used.
