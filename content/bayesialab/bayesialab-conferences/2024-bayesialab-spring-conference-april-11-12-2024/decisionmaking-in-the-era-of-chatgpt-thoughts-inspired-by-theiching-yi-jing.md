# üá´üá∑ Decision-Making in the Era of ChatGPT: Thoughts Inspired by the I Ching (ÊòìÁªè)

To be presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 12, 2024.

### Abstract

I propose a 3,000-year journey through time and space, from the earliest traces of oracular practices and the I Ching to the current use of so-called ‚Äúgenerative (probabilistic) artificial intelligence (modeling)‚Äù with Bayesialab as a fabulous pedagogical tool.

Not forgetting God and a game of dice, this talk will question our perceptions of the world, our relationship to chance, and, by the way, our attitude to the eternal question of how to make (good...) decisions as humans in an ever-changing world Êòì!
