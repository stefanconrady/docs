# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Transforming Paper Product Quality and Machine Performance with Machine Learning & Bayesian Networks

Presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 12, 2024.

### Abstract

This presentation explores the application of machine learning and Bayesian networks to enhance tissue softness, a crucial factor in the paper product industry. It begins with the presenter's extensive background in engineering and analytics, setting the stage for a deep dive into utilizing Bayesian networks to improve tissue manufacturing processes.

The focus is on refining the balance between paper strength and softness, crucial for producing high-quality tissue. The presentation covers the technicalities of tissue production, from fiber refining to the mechanics of papermaking, illustrating the complex interplay of factors affecting product quality.

A significant portion is dedicated to the evolution of model development, from initial challenges to advanced iterations that accurately predict tissue softness. Techniques like Jackknife and K-Fold cross-validation are discussed for model evaluation, highlighting the learning curve and adjustments made to enhance model performance.

Operational insights form the core of the latter part, where data analysis reveals optimal manufacturing conditions. The presentation touches on the importance of data integrity, model adaptability, and the role of human operators in implementing AI-driven recommendations.

Concluding, the presentation reflects on the project's broader impacts, emphasizing continuous improvement, user readiness, and aligning project goals with customer expectations. This summary encapsulates the journey and lessons learned in applying advanced analytics to improve tissue softness, underscoring the potential of machine learning in industrial applications.
