# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Collaborative Intelligence

To be presented at the [2024 BayesiaLab Spring Conference](./) in Cincinnati on April 11, 2024.

### Abstract

This presentation picks up where my previous one ended ([From Explanations to Interpretations](../2022-bayesialab-conference-10th-anniversary/from-explanation-to-interpretations.md) at the [2022 BayesiaLab Conference](../2022-bayesialab-conference-10th-anniversary/)). Back then, I described our approach to optimize the strengths of machines and humans through interpretable AI. This time, we will focus on the key elements that can make this a winning vs. losing combination (hint: not trivial and not obvious). We will explore the benefits of a neuro-symbolic approach and conclude with a proposed framework for optimal collaborative intelligence.
