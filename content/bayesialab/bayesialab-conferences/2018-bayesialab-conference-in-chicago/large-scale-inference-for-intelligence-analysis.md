# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Large-Scale Inference for Intelligence Analysis

Presented at the [6th Annual BayesiaLab Conference in Chicago](./), November 1-2, 2018.

### Abstract <a href="#h2_148496644" id="h2_148496644"></a>

The large amounts of data related to threats in the cyber environment and the theoretical developments in probabilistic reasoning in the last few decades have enabled better ways to reason about threat intelligence. In this talk, I will give an overview of the historical developments that underlie the foundation of our work using Bayesian Networks and probabilistic reasoning to tackle some of the problems faced in computer security, together with some examples of areas where they are being applied with practical and interpretable results.
