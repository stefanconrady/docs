# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Optimizing Mix of Local Media & Promotional Budgets

Presented at the [6th Annual BayesiaLab Conference in Chicago](./), November 1-2, 2018.

### Abstract <a href="#h2_148496644" id="h2_148496644"></a>

Our client, a US top 10 optical retailer, was spending significant dollars on promotion and media budgets in local markets in pursuit of aggressive growth plans in the U.S. As plans were being made to expand distribution to new markets, senior executives required greater decision support on how much to budget for promotion versus media across local markets.

Some of the key questions they were trying to solve:

* Should less money be spent on promotion and more on brand media advertising to generate growth in local markets?
* Which promotions and media have historically been high contributors to sales across all markets?
* How can media and promotional dollars be optimized locally across the top 10 key markets?
* What is the ROI on media and promotional spending, and how can it be maximized going forward to meet sales objectives?

The presentation highlights the use of Bayesialab as the primary software for understanding causal relationships among media and promotions at the local market level. We also used additional open-source programming software like R/python for data aggregation and running scenarios to optimize promotional and media budgets.
