# 🇺🇸 Bayesian-Neural Networks Ensemble Modeling: An Initial Experiment

Presented at the [6th Annual BayesiaLab Conference in Chicago](./), November 1-2, 2018.

### Abstract <a href="#h2_148496644" id="h2_148496644"></a>

Neural networks can achieve strong predictive accuracy in situations in which predictor variables exhibit nonlinear relationships with the targeted outcome of the “dependent” variable. However, a significant drawback of neural networks is their "black box" nature. It can be difficult to impossible to understand the “why” behind a neural network’s predictions. The goal of "explainable machine learning" is to address this black box challenge. This presentation reports results from an initial experiment that uses the often-explored Sonar data set to test whether a synergetic combination of BayesiaLab and neural network modeling might be able to address the explainable machine learning challenge while possibly also increasing the accuracy of predictive models.
