# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Unsupervised Bayesian Network Learning for Non-Obvious Marketing Insight

Presented at the [6th Annual BayesiaLab Conference in Chicago](./), November 1-2, 2018.

### Abstract

Marketing researchers frequently deploy consumer surveys to test marketing hypotheses or to segment their potential audience. This paper shows examples of how Unsupervised Bayesian Networks unlock additional insights from consumer surveys beyond their original purposes. Unsupervised Learning approaches the data from an assumption-free perspective of knowledge representation. It discovers the underlying structures of consumer demand and expectations within the market.

The paper outlines the challenges and opportunities of Unstructured Learning, sets out best practices for analyzing consumer marketing data, and presents three case studies drawn from survey data on consumer packaged goods, restaurants, and Internet services. It draws some non-obvious conclusions in each of the three domains, suggests new directions in product development, and refines value propositions.
