# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· A Meta-Model for Predicting the Quality of Knowledge Elicitation Sessions

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Tuesday, October 25, 2022, at 13:30 (UTC).

### Abstract

Capitalizing on expert knowledge can be useful for a company. It can be for transmitting all the know-how on a given field, incorporating technical aspects for decision making, or building causal models for doing prediction. This knowledge can be represented through a Bayesian Network in order to introduce uncertainty on the phenomenon, and, combined with Data, its performance can be improved. Elicitation is done thanks to sessions where expert works together to build models thanks to a facilitator and a modeler. The experts are asked to be available for a given amount of time, which can be large (several days), with a risk that at the end of the sessions, they will not be able to have a satisfying tool. In the context of multi-project management, we propose a tool to assess the probability of success of Elicitation sessions on a given problem. This tool is obtained thanks to the Elicitation of a Bayesian Network (meta-model).
