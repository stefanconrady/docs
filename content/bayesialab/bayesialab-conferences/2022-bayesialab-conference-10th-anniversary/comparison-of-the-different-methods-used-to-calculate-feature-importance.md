# ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Comparison of the Different Methods Used to Calculate Feature Importance

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Wednesday, October 26, 2022.&#x20;

### Abstract&#x20;

The topic of the presentation is comparing the different ways of calculating the feature importance: Shapley Value Regression in R, Bayesian Network in BayesiaLab software, Random Forest in R and shap library in Python. The paper aims to show the similarities and differences between considered approaches.

The entire process is based on the data simulation using copulas in which different scenarios are tested to account for the limitations of survey data, e.g., data skewness.

In the paper, the author tests the different strengths of relationships between the independent variables, the number of predictors, and the measurement scales (binary, Likert scale).

The author used a model agnostic approach called permutation feature importance as a comparison benchmark.
