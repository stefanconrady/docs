# üáßüá∑ Bayesian Networks and Network Science Applied to Water Resources: Streamflow Analysis and Forecast

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Monday, October 24, 2022.

### Abstract&#x20;

The thesis entitled ‚ÄúBayesian Networks and Network Science Applied to Water Resources: Streamflow Analysis and Forecast incorporating the Non-Stationarity‚Äù aimed to develop methodologies to (1) identify the existence of changes in the streamflow time series and its location, (2) incorporate this aspect in the streamflow modeling and forecasting framework and (3) analyze the full extension regarding its impact. The focus on Bayesian Networks, as an alternative approach to classical streamflow modeling methodologies, relied upon recent articles that indicated Bayesian Networks as a promising tool in hydroclimate studies, simultaneously providing good modeling results and allowing causal discovery through the analysis of the network structure. A first attempt to incorporate this non-stationarity was made using Gaussian Bayesian Networks (GBN). Discrete variables representing the different phases of low-frequency oscillations were included in the networks, allowing different network parameters according to the phases. The results demonstrated the great potential of the GBN to forecast streamflow with lead times from one to eight months. The results also unveiled a good streamflow forecasting potential via Bayesian Inference based on Likelihood Weighting simulations. The use of the phases resulted in performance improvement for some stations, however, it did not improve the results of the stations that presented changes in the time series, suggesting significant changes between the network structures of each homogeneous period. Network structures were obtained through different methodologies for each homogeneous period to analyze this aspect. The results confirmed the initial hypothesis, showing significant differences between the network structures of each homogeneous period, with alterations in the relationship between the variables and their autocorrelation function. Therefore, the use of the same set of parents for the complete series may not comprise the extension of the changes observed.
