# üá®üá¶ A Causal Framework for Analyzing Cumulative Environmental Impacts

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Monday, October 24, 2022.

Abstract Significant environmental degradation is rarely the result of a single, acute event but is more often caused by the additive and/or synergistic effects of several stressors. Assessing these ‚Äúcumulative impacts‚Äù is an important component of environmental assessments, but the procedures for calculating such impacts are theoretically weak and could generate misleading estimates of project impacts. Here, I propose a framework for analyzing cumulative environmental impacts that is rooted in causal theory. Specifically, I argue for the application of causal models and the explicit incorporation of ‚Äúrung three‚Äù counterfactual reasoning from Pearl‚Äôs causal hierarchy. The important but underused concepts of necessary and sufficient causation are prominent in the proposed framework and lead to surprising assessment results when used to estimate the effects of industrial development on grizzly bear and caribou populations.
