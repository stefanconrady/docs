# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Innovations in Knowledge Elicitation

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on October 24, 2022.

### Abstract&#x20;

Knowledge elicitation from domain experts is a key area of interest for the BayesiaLab Team. In this year's technology presentation, Dr. Lionel Jouffe introduces several innovations in structural knowledge elicitation, which are now implemented in the BEKEE ([Bayesia Expert Knowledge Elicitation Environment](../../../bekee/bayesia-expert-knowledge-elicitation-environment-bekee.md)) workflow.
