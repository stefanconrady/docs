# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Integrating Market Research with Applied Analytics to Boost Technology Service Trust

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Wednesday, October 26, 2022.&#x20;

### Abstract&#x20;

Surveys of primary search are conducted at different frequencies across segments to determine satisfaction metrics and brand perception for the brand and its competitors. A telemetry of the consumer is also measured by the number of issues, severity, the time required to resolve, and satisfaction by category. Modeling begins with exploratory factor analysis and probabilistic structural equations. The results show that these factors affect consumers' brand trust and are visualized in a network graph of association. The relationship network structure is derived using both controllable and latent factors, including service history and surveys, as well as socioeconomic and market factors.

As part of my talk, I will elaborate on the importance of brand trust in commercial consumer behavior and marketing management, particularly for cloud services. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of factors on consumersâ€™ brand loyalty in products and service businesses leading to trust and love and recommend constraint-driven changes to improve.
