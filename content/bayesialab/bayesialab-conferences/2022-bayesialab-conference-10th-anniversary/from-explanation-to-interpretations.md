Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Wednesday, October 26, 2022.&#x20;

### Abstract&#x20;

ML practitioners have traditionally had to make a choice between the most performant models and those that allow for clear explanations of model decisions. With the recent advent of powerful XAI techniques, this is becoming less of an issue as formerly black box models become (more) transparent. Using these tools on large, complex, real-world tabular datasets, however, can lead to disappointing results that fall short of what is necessary for key stakeholders to use and trust system decisions. Using Bayesian networks, we propose a method that can help build a bridge between machine and expert ‚Äúreasoning.‚Äù We show that applied to the classification of stock market investments ‚Äì a field with a notoriously low signal-to-noise ratio ‚Äì this method can help bring the best of man and machine working together to tackle new problems in applied data science.
