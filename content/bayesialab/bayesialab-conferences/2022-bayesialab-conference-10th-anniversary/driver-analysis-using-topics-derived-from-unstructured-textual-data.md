# üá∫üá∏ Driver Analysis Using Topics Derived From Unstructured Textual Data

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Wednesday, October 26, 2022.

### Abstract&#x20;

We investigated how to conduct driver analysis based on topics derived from unstructured textual data. These data include online consumer reviews, ratings, complaints, comments, and verbatims in surveys. The major challenge is the high missing rate of topics in each individual textual document. As an example, each consumer review may just mention a few topics. This leads to an overall higher missing rate in the data. Without knowing the explicit missing mechanism, BayesiaLab recommended using Approximate Dynamic Imputation (ADI) to impute the missing values. We performed simulations to study different methods of processing missing data and performing driver and impact analysis. With complete and missing simulated data (a mixed missing mechanism), Filtered State and ADI tend to learn the same or very similar model structures, drivers, and impacts. At a low missing rate (\~10%), structures, drivers, and impacts are the same as those from the simulated Ground Truth BBN model; at a medium missing rate (40-60%), they also tend to be the same or very similar as GT BBN model through equivalent model structures; at a high missing rate (80%), they tend to recover most of the correct structure, drivers and impacts.

### About the Presenter&#x20;

Dr. Yong Zhang leverages Bayesian data and modeling science to develop strategies for product design, manufacturing, storage, and transportation across P\&G to improve consumers‚Äô life quality and positively influence the environment and society. He develops first principle and data science/machine learning methods and tools through Front-End Innovation projects to enable and promote the capability across P\&G for breakthrough consumer understanding and product innovation. The methods and tools can be used to extract and integrate information from a variety of data sources to find a ‚ÄúBody of Evidence‚Äù for consumer and product research based on Nonparametric Bayesian statistics and deep learning algorithms.
