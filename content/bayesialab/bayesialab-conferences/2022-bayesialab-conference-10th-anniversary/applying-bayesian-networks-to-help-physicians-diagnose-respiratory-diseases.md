# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ Applying Bayesian Networks to Help Physicians Diagnose Respiratory Diseases

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Friday, October 28, 2022.

### Abstract&#x20;

The differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases is usually a challenge for medical specialists in the first line of care, which has increased under the current COVID-19 pandemic. A Clinical Decision Support System â€” CDSS â€” is being developed using Bayesian Networks â€“ BNs â€“ to help physicians diagnose respiratory diseases, including those related to COVID-19. Network structure has been elicited from expert physicians, and network parameters (disease prevalence, symptoms, findings, and lab results conditional probabilities) were extracted from relevant bibliography or currently standard global information sources. The CDSS is being tested using case studies taken from real situations, provided and validated by physicians. The resulting system demonstrates the suitability and flexibility of BNs for diagnosis support.
