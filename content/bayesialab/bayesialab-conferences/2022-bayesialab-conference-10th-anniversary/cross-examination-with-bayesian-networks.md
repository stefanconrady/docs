# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Cross-Examination with Bayesian Networks

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Thursday, October 27, 2022.&#x20;

### Abstract&#x20;

Cross-examination is a method for testing the evidence presented at trial by asking probing questions. It is an integral part of the right to confront oneâ€™s accusers, as enshrined in the constitutions of many countries. But there is little scholarly work that analyzes cross-examination, its scope, and its function at trial. Until we know what cross-examination consists in, the substance of the fundamental right to confrontation remains elusive. This talk makes a first attempt at clearing the ground by articulating an analysis of cross-examination using Bayesian networks. This conceptual ground clearing will provide a framework to identify when cross-examination may go wrong and hinder the search for an accurate determination of the facts.
