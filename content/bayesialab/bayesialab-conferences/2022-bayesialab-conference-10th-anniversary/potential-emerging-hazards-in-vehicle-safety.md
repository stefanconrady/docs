# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Potential Emerging Hazards in Vehicle Safety

Presented at the [10th Annual BayesiaLab Conference](./) on Friday, October 28, 2022.

### Abstract&#x20;

GMâ€™s experience shows that expanded data access must be coupled with tools that can manage volume, techniques that appropriately control for exposure and sample bias, and processes that incorporate SME knowledge. BayesiaLab helps GM address these critical issues, with one tool, in a way that is intuitive and makes communication with engineers easier to support vehicle hazard investigations.
