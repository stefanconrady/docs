# üñ•Ô∏è 2024 BayesiaLab E-Summit

### Welcome to the 2024 BayesiaLab E-Summit

**October 11‚Äì12, 2024 ‚Äì A Zoom Virtual Event**

The BayesiaLab E-Summit is the new format of what used to be the BayesiaLab Fall Conference. Post-COVID, we have established a new routine for our biannual events. Each spring, our community will meet face-to-face at the BayesiaLab Conference, like we did in the spring of 2024 in Cincinnati, and every fall, we will gather online at the BayesiaLab E-Summit.

In either format, these meetings stand out as the premier events dedicated to applied research with Bayesian networks. They aim to promote the practical deployment of Bayesian networks in research, analytics, and problem-solving.

What started in 2013 in Orlando, Florida, as a modest gathering has now blossomed into an international event, drawing attendees from various corners of the world. Over the years, our conferences and virtual events have fostered a vibrant community comprising researchers and professionals from many domains.
