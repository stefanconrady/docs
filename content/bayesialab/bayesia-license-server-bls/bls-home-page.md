* Also, you can always access the Personal Information tab from other areas in BLS by selecting Personal Information from the drop-down menu attached to your Username in the upper right-hand corner of the browser window.

### Sign Into Another Account

* Clicking Sign Into Another Account allows you to connect your personal Username to a different or additional Account.
* For instance, you may want to add a Single-User/Single-Machine license that your company purchased for you. In this case, you would add the Client Identifier (AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD) of that new license.&#x20;

* If you were adding the Client Identifier of a Floating Token License to your Username â€” and also the _first one_ in your organization to do so, you would automatically become an Account Manager.&#x20;
* If there were already an existing Account Manager, he would be notified by email to validate your request. In this case, an Account Manager can validate your access via the [User Access Validation](bls-home-page.md#user-access-validation) tab.

### Enter Your Voucher

* A Voucher is a personal code that Bayesia can provide for specific products and purposes, such as Private WebSimulator Accounts. Simply enter your Voucher Code and click Validate.

### User Access Validation

* If you are an Account Manager, you can use the User Access Validation tab to approve Usernames to attach themselves to existing Client Identifiers and, thus, use the corresponding license.
