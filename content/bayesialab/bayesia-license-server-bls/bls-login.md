# BLS Login

### Accessing the Bayesia License Server (BLS)

#### Using Your Existing Credentials

* Regular access to the Bayesia License Server (BLS) requires credentials in the form of a username and password.
* Your username and password uniquely identify you as an individual end-user.
* Your username is always set to your active email address. While an email address per se _is not_ case-sensitive, the username for BLS _is_ case-sensitive.&#x20;
* Your password would be sent from bls@bayesia.com with the subject line _Bayesia License Server Login Information_ to the email address set as your Username.&#x20;
* Your credentials apply across all Bayesia products, e.g., for starting a session using a Floating Token License or accessing the WebSimulator as Administrator.&#x20;
* To log in to Bayesia License Server (BLS), please open a web browser and visit [https://bls1.bayesia.com](https://bls1.bayesia.com/).
* Then, enter your credentials and click Submit.

* If your credentials are correct, you will be taken to your Bayesia License Server Home Page (please see the [BLS Access Flowchart](bls-login.md#bls-access-flowchart) flowchart below)

You must not share your credentials with anyone, not even with someone in your organization who might be entitled to access the same product as you.

### Forgot Your Password

* If you don't remember your password, please check your email inbox or your spam folder for messages from bls@bayesia.com. Chances are that you can find your credentials there.
* If you cannot find your password, click Forgot your password? and enter your Username, i.e., your email address. If your Username is valid_**,**_ you will receive an email from bls@bayesia.com with a new password. Once you have your new password, you can return to the login page.

### Access for First-Time Users

* There are two ways for first-time BayesiaLab users to create their new user profiles (see BLS Access Flowchart), i.e., using a [Registration Code](bls-login.md#using-a-registration-code) or a [Client Identifier](bls-login.md#using-a-client-identifier).

#### **Using a Registration Code**

* Registration Codes are typically used for signing up a larger group of users. For example, an Account Manager may create and distribute such a Registration Code so every participant in a class can create their own user profile.
* Please select Registration Code and fill in your details plus the Registration Code you received, and then click Submit.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Please note that whatever you enter as your email address will become your Username, exactly the way you spelled it and capitalized it.&#x20;
* We strongly recommend using lowercase characters only.
{% endhint %}

* Upon submission, your new Username will be associated with the Account that generated the Registration Code.
* Furthermore, you will receive two emails, both sent by bls@bayesia.com:&#x20;
  * An email with the subject line _Bayesia License Server Login Information_, which confirms your Username and provides your password.
  * An email with the subject line _BayesiaLab Download & Activation Instructions_, which contains a link for downloading the BayesiaLab installation files.

#### **Using a Client Identifier**

* Depending on the way you or your organization licensed BayesiaLab, you may receive a Client Identifier in the following format: AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD.
* Please select Client Identifier and provide your details plus the Client Identifier and then click Submit.\

* Please note that whatever you enter as your email address will become your Username, exactly the way you spelled it and capitalized it.&#x20;
* We strongly recommend using lowercase characters only.
{% endhint %}

* Upon submission, your new Username will be associated with the Account that generated the Registration Code.
* Upon submission, your Username will be associated with the Client Identifier you provided.
* Furthermore, you will receive an email from bls@bayesia.com with the subject line _Bayesia License Server Login Information_, which confirms your Username and provides your password.
* A Client Identifier is directly linked to a specific license and license term of a BayesiaLab product. Please note that the Client Identifier exists even before any Usernames are created. So, by registering with a Client Identifier, you attach your Username to an existing Client Identifier, like adding your name to a title of a vehicle that already has a VIN or serial number.
  * If you are the _first_ Username to register with this **Client Identifier**, you "claim" that Client Identifier and will automatically become an **Account Manager**.
  * If additional Usernames register with the same **Client Identifier** _after you_, you will receive an email asking you — as an Account Manager —  to validate their registration as new Users.
  * Conversely, if you are _not_ the first one to register, you will need to wait for approval from an **Account Manager** before you can connect to BLS with your Username.
