* Given the wealth of information available on the Session Dashboard, you may want to limit the presentation of data to certain subsets.
* You can set filters for:
  * Users
  * Subscriptions
  * Time Periods
* Any filter you define here applies to all [Dashboard Views](bls-session-dashboard.md#dashboard-views).

### Dashboard Views

#### Charts

* Under the Charts tab, you can view plots for numerous usage metrics:
  * Sessions time: total time of usage by day
  * Sessions number: total number of sessions by day
  * Session result: the failure rate of sessions, e.g., due to connection problems with BLS
  * Parallel sessions: number of concurrent users by day
  * Max parallel sessions: maximum number of simultaneous user sessions in a day

#### User Information

  * ![](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/resources/Storage/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/BlabC/attachments/5668873/5799941.png) the user is not running BayesiaLab.
  * ![](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/resources/Storage/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/BlabC/attachments/5668873/5799943.png) the user is currently connected to BLS.
  * ![](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/resources/Storage/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/BlabC/attachments/5668873/5799942.png) the user is currently "borrowing a token" and running BayesiaLab offline without a connection to BLS.

**Actions**

* In the Actions column, a Manager can send messages to any User who is currently connected to BLS or, if necessary, close or "kill" any active Session.

* Closing a Session can be helpful, for instance, when a user forgets to close his BayesiaLab session, thus "hogging" a token and preventing another User from starting a Session.

#### Connection Map

* The Connection Map shows all the locations where your BayesiaLab tokens have been used.
