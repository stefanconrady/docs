# Where is Bayesia Located?

### Bayesia S.A.S. — Since 2001

Parc Ceres, Batiment N\
21, rue Ferdinand Buisson\
53810 Change, France

Even though Bayesia's R\&D team is fully occupied with BayesiaLab's development roadmap, everyone in the organization also spends time on consulting projects with clients. Dr. Jouffe says, "We must be intimately familiar with our customers' evolving research challenges so the tools we develop fit into their workflows. We are driven by the idea that software should naturally anticipate the user's next steps and yet offer a maximum degree of flexibility to the researcher. After all, research is a voyage of discovery and not a script."&#x20;

### Bayesia USA, LLC — Since 2010

4235 Hillsboro Pike\

In his capacity as head of analytics and forecasting at Nissan North America, Stefan Conrady started collaborating with Bayesia in 2009 on market research applications of BayesiaLab in the auto industry. Convinced of BayesiaLab's tremendous potential beyond its home market in Europe, Stefan founded Bayesia USA in 2010 to serve as the French company's North American sales and marketing partner.

In their first year of operation, Bayesia USA already managed to sign up a number of blue-chip clients, such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, InterContinental Hotels Group, and Dell Computers, and add them to the expanding list of BayesiaLab users around the world. Bayesia USA has also become the center for educational activities around BayesiaLab, hosting webinars, workshops, and training seminars around North America. The 382-page book [Bayesian Networks & BayesiaLab — A Practical Introduction for Researchers](../e-book-bayesian-networks-and-bayesialab-a-practical-introduction-for-researchers/), co-authored by Stefan Conrady and Lionel Jouffe, is the latest product of Bayesia's international teamwork.&#x20;

Stefan's work experience with some of the world's leading automobile brands, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, instilled in him a sense of commitment to total customer satisfaction. "If the customer runs into a roadblock, for whatever reason, our team will try the utmost to solve the problem." He adds, "Research is expensive, and BayesiaLab is a big technology investment, so our clients can't afford any downtime. For them, it's critically important to be able to rely on our industrial-strength support."
