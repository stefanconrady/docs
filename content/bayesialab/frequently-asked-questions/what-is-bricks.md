# What is BRICKS?

* BRICKS is a Probabilistic Relational Modeling framework that supports creating and utilizing models of large-scale and complex systems.
* The BRICKS methodology consists of three distinct phases:
  1. The knowledge modeling phase produces a generic knowledge base of BRICKS classes.
  2. The system design produces the model itself by instantiating the previously created BRICKS classes.
  3. The querying phase lets you interact with the model by providing observations and requesting probability distributions.
