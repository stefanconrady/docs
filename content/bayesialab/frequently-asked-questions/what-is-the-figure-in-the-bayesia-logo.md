The Thinker of Hamangia is a famous Neolithic sculpture discovered in the Hamangia culture of Romania. It is a small statue made of baked clay dating back to around 5,000 BC, making it one of Europe's oldest examples of sculpture. The statue depicts a seated figure with its chin resting on one hand, suggesting a contemplative or thoughtful posture, hence its name. It is considered a significant artifact in understanding the art and culture of prehistoric Europe.

The statue depicts a figure in a contemplative pose, which symbolizes deep thought and intellectual explorationâ€”concepts closely associated with Bayesia's innovations in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, the statue pays homage to the home country of Dr. Paul Munteanu, one of Bayesia's co-founders.
