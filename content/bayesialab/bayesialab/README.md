### Overview

* BayesiaLab is a powerful desktop application (Windows/Mac/Unix) that provides scientists with a comprehensive ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for machine learning, knowledge modeling, probabilistic reasoning (incl. diagnosis and simulation), causal inference, and optimization.&#x20;
* BayesiaLab utilizes the Bayesian network framework for gaining deep insights into problem domains and reasoning about them.&#x20;
* BayesiaLab is the result of more than twenty years of research by Dr. Lionel Jouffe and Dr. Paul Munteanu and their team of computer scientists. Their company, Bayesia S.A.S., is headquartered in Laval in northwestern France, with affiliates in the U.S. and Singapore.
* Today, Bayesia S.A.S. is the world‚Äôs leading supplier of Bayesian network software, serving hundreds of major corporations and research organizations around the world. &#x20;
