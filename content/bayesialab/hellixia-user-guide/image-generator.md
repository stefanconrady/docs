# Image Generator

### Context

* In addition to utilizing ChatGPT, BayesiaLab's Hellixia subject matter assistant also employs DALL-E.&#x20;
* DALL-E is a variant of the GPT model designed to generate images from textual descriptions.&#x20;
* This functionality is useful for creating small images that visualize what the node represents.

### Usage & Example

* To use the Image Generator, select the nodes for which you want an image produced.
* Select `Main Menu > Hellixia > Image Generator`.
* In the Image Generator window, specify the fields that contain the subjects, i.e., the textual descriptions of the images to be generated. Check all that apply.
* Under Context, you can state the overall domain of the image subjects, if applicable.
