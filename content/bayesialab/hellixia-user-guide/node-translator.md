# Node Translator

### Context

* The Hellixia Node Translator is powered by ChatGPT and DeepL.
* It allows you to easily translate the Node Names, the State Names, and any Node Comments into another language.

### Usage & Example

* We use an unconnected network featuring 240 statements that are all related to personality and character traits, e.g., "I get angry easily", or "I smile a lot".
* These statements are contained in the Node Names.

* The Node Names are in English, and we want to translate them into German.
* Select all nodes to be translated.
* Then, select Main Menu > Hellixia > Node Translator.
* In the Node Translator window, you can pick the target language from the dropdown menu.
* You can also specify the Translator Model, e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or DeepL.
* Finally, you need to check what Node Properties should be translated, e.g., Node Names, State Names, or Node Comments. Check all that apply.

* Clicking OK starts the translation process.&#x20;
* Once the process has concluded, all node names appear in German.
