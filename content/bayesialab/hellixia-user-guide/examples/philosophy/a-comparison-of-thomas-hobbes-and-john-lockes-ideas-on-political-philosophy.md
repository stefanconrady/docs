Step into a realm where two of the Enlightenment's most profound thinkers, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, are set side by side for scrutiny. This section is dedicated to a comparative analysis of these philosophical giants using the insights provided by Hellixia. While both philosophers tackled the nature of the social contract, governance, and human nature, their conclusions often diverged, leading to rich philosophical debates that resonate today. With the aid of semantic networks, we'll untangle the intricate threads of their arguments, highlighting areas of agreement and divergence. This exploration promises a study of their philosophies and a deeper understanding of the broader political and ethical landscape they helped shape. Join us in this captivating journey as we traverse the intricate terrains of Hobbesian and Lockean thought.



### Workflow for Creating a Semantic Network

* Start by creating the node "Thomas Hobbes and John Locke". &#x20;
* Use the **Dimension Elicitor** with a broad array of keywords like "Perspectives, Rules, Divergences, Ideas, Topics, Similarities and Differences", and set the **General Context** to "Political Philosophy."&#x20;
* Inspect the dimensions returned by Hellixia and eliminate any that seem superfluous or unrelated to your analysis. Next, disregard the "Thomas Hobbes and John Locke" node and run the **Embedding Generator** on all remaining nodes to apprehend the semantic associations of their names and comments.
* Use the **Maximum Weight Spanning Tree** algorithm to generate a semantic network.&#x20;
* Change node styles to **Badges** to ensure each node's comment is visible. Then, apply the **Dynamic Grid Layout** to position the nodes on your graph; remember that this algorithm is not deterministic, and its orientation—vertical, horizontal, or mixed—is random. You might need to execute this layout several times to obtain an arrangement that aligns with your taste.
* Switch over to **Validation Mode** and select **Skeleton View**. Since your network doesn't represent causal relations, **Skeleton View** will maintain only node connections without indicating a direction.

### Workflow for the Node Force analysis

* Return to **Modeling Mode** and alter the node styles to **Discs**.&#x20;
* Use the **Symmetric Layout** and switch to **Validation Mode** to run a **Node Force** analysis.
