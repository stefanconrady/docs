Welcome to our in-depth analysis of "[The Mercy Seat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahr4KFl79WI\&ab\_channel=NickCaveandtheBadSeeds)," an iconic song by Nick Cave. Through this exploration, we will delve into the intricate narratives and powerful emotions embedded within the song. Using Hellixia, we will construct a semantic network that reveals the song's complex themes and the relationships among them, shedding light on the profound depths of Cave's storytelling. Join us as we journey into the haunting world of "The Mercy Seat."

### Workflow for Creating the Semantic Network

* Start by creating the node "Τhe Mercy Seat". &#x20;
* Use the **Dimension Elicitor** with a broad array of keywords like "Achievements," "Characteristics," "Ideas," and "Impacts" (see the exhaustive list below), and set the **General Context** to "Nick Cave Song." By doing so, you're informing the tool to approach the analysis with the perspective to a song by Nick Cave.

* Inspect the dimensions returned by Hellixia and eliminate any that seem superfluous or unrelated to your analysis. Next, disregard the "The Mercy Seat" node and run the **Embedding Generator** on all remaining nodes to apprehend the semantic associations of their names and comments.
* Use the **Maximum Weight Spanning Tree** algorithm to generate a semantic network.&#x20;
* Change node styles to **Badges** to ensure each node's comment is visible. Then, apply the **Dynamic Grid Layout** to position the nodes on your graph; remember that this algorithm is not deterministic, and its orientation—vertical, horizontal, or mixed—is random. You might need to execute this layout several times to obtain an arrangement that aligns with your taste.
* Switch over to **Validation Mode** and select **Skeleton View**. Since your network doesn't represent causal relations, **Skeleton View** will maintain only node connections without indicating a direction.

### Workflow for Node Force Analysis

* Return to **Modeling Mode** and alter the node styles to **Discs**.&#x20;
* Use the **Symmetric Layout** and switch to **Validation Mode** to run a **Node Force** analysis.

### Workflow for Creating a Hierarchical Semantic Network

* Execute **Variable Clustering**: This operation will categorize analogous variables based on their semantic relationships.

* Open the **Class Editor** and run **Class Description Generator** to generate descriptive names for the factors in question. Use the **Export Descriptions** function, and save the newly created descriptions.
* Return to **Modeling Mode** and run **Multiple Clustering** to generate latent variables.&#x20;
* Run the structural learning algorithm **Taboo**. Ensure the "**Delete Unfixed Arcs**" option is enabled.
* Use the descriptions you exported earlier as a **Dictionary** to rename the latent variables you've created.
* Switch to **Validation** and apply **Node Force**.

* Given the size of this network, we can focus on the upper level of the hierarchical network. Below is the Node Force analysis on these factors only, i.e., excluding all manifest variables before the analysis.&#x20;
