## **Narrative Analysis**

Let's delve into the very fabric of "Red Right Hand," examining its lyrical landscape to uncover the embedded stories, motifs, and emotions they evoke.

### Workflow for Creating the Semantic Network

* Start by creating the node "Lyrics of The Red Right Hand, by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds." &#x20;
* Input the lyrics into the comment section of the node:

```
Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand
He'll wrap you in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand
You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
'Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand
You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand
```

* Use the **Dimension Elicitor**, employing the keywords "Agents, Keywords, Events, Relationships, Developments, Contexts, Highlights, Milestones, Entities, Progressions, Motifs, and Locations" to conduct an exhaustive narrative analysis of the lyrics.&#x20;
* Inspect the dimensions returned by Hellixia and eliminate any that seem superfluous or unrelated to your analysis. Next, disregard the "Lyrics of The Red Right Hand, by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds" node and run the **Embedding Generator** on all remaining nodes to apprehend the semantic associations of their names and comments.
* Use the **Maximum Weight Spanning Tree** algorithm to generate a semantic network.&#x20;
* Change node styles to **Badges** to ensure each node's comment is visible. Then, apply the **Dynamic Grid Layout** to position the nodes on your graph; remember that this algorithm is not deterministic, and its orientation—vertical, horizontal, or mixed—is random. You might need to execute this layout several times to obtain an arrangement that aligns with your taste.
* Switch over to **Validation Mode** and select **Skeleton View**. Since your network doesn't represent causal relations, **Skeleton View** will maintain only node connections without indicating a direction.

### Workflow for the Node Force analysis

* Return to **Modeling Mode** and change the node styles to **Discs**.&#x20;
* Use the **Symmetric Layout** and switch to **Validation Mode** to run a **Node Force** analysis.

### Workflow for creating the Hierarchical Semantic Network

* Execute **Variable Clustering**: This operation will categorize analogous variables based on semantic relationships.

* Open the **Class Editor** and run **Class Description Generator** to generate descriptive names for the factors in question. Use the **Export Descriptions** function, and save the newly created descriptions.
* Return to **Modeling Mode** and run **Multiple Clustering** to generate latent variables.&#x20;
* Run the structural learning algorithm **Taboo**. Ensure the "**Delete Unfixed Arcs**" option is enabled.
* Use the descriptions you exported earlier as a **Dictionary** to rename the latent variables you've created.
* Switch to **Validation** and run **Node Force**.

* Given the size of this network, we can focus on the upper level of the hierarchical network. Below is the **Node Force** analysis on these factors only, i.e., excluding all manifest variables before the analysis.&#x20;
