# Causality

In the realm of advanced data analysis and knowledge modeling, understanding the underpinnings of causality is crucial. Hellixia, at the forefront of this analytical revolution, offers a set of functions dedicated to causality, enabling the generation of Causal Semantic Networks (CSN) and Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN). This section is aimed at engineers and researchers seeking to unravel the complexity of cause-and-effect relationships in their field.
