In the vast tapestry of Shakespearean tragedies, "King Lear" stands out as a potent tale of familial strife, ambition, and the relentless quest for power. As we journey into this masterwork, we find ourselves amidst the tumultuous relationships of a king with his children, set against the backdrop of a kingdom in disarray.

Having ventured into the intricate worlds of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth", we now shift our focus to this powerful narrative. Our exploration is structured in two parts: we begin with a detailed narrative analysis, diving deep into plot intricacies and character dynamics. Following this, we transition to a holistic analysis, capturing overarching themes, motives, and the very essence that makes "King Lear" a cornerstone of literary greatness.

With the precision of Hellixia guiding our analysis, join us in this enlightening expedition as we endeavor to unveil the complexities and profundities that Shakespeare so masterfully wove into the fabric of "King Lear".

## Narrative Analysis

Navigating "King Lear", our narrative analysis dissects the play's pivotal events and character dynamics. We'll unravel the tale of a father, his daughters, and a kingdom in turmoil, shedding light on Shakespeare's intricate storytelling.

### Workflow for Creating a Semantic Network

* Start by creating the node "King Lear, by Shakespeare." &#x20;
* Use the **Dimension Elicitor**, employing a broad array of keywords: Agents, Contexts, Developments, Entities, Events, Highlights, Keywords, Locations, Milestones, Motifs, Progressions, and Relationships.
* Inspect the dimensions returned by Hellixia and eliminate any that seem superfluous or unrelated to your analysis. Next, disregard the "King Lear, by Shakespeare" node and run the **Embedding Generator** on all remaining nodes to apprehend the semantic associations of their names and comments.
* Use the **Maximum Weight Spanning Tree** algorithm to generate a semantic network.&#x20;
* Change node styles to **Badges** to ensure each node's comment is visible. Then, apply the **Dynamic Grid Layout** to position the nodes on your graph; remember that this algorithm is not deterministic, and its orientation—vertical, horizontal, or mixed—is random. You might need to execute this layout several times to obtain an arrangement that aligns with your taste.
* Switch over to **Validation Mode** and select **Skeleton View**. Since your network doesn't represent causal relations, **Skeleton View** will maintain only node connections without indicating a direction.

### Workflow for Node Force Analysis

* Return to **Modeling Mode** and alter the node styles to **Discs**.&#x20;
* Use the **Symmetric Layout** and switch to **Validation Mode** to run a **Node Force** analysis.

### Workflow for Creating the Hierarchical Semantic Network

* Execute **Variable Clustering**: This operation will categorize analogous variables based on their semantic relationships.

* Open the **Class Editor** and run **Class Description Generator** to generate descriptive names for the factors. Use the **Export Descriptions** function and save the newly created descriptions.
* Return to **Modeling Mode** and run **Multiple Clustering** to generate latent variables.&#x20;
* Run the structural learning algorithm **Taboo**. Ensure the "**Delete Unfixed Arcs**" option is enabled.
* Use the descriptions you exported earlier as a **Dictionary** to rename the latent variables you've created.
* Switch to **Validation** and run **Node Force**.

* Given the size of this network, we can focus on the upper level of the hierarchical network. Below is the **Node Force** analysis on these factors only, i.e., excluding all manifest variables before the analysis.&#x20;
