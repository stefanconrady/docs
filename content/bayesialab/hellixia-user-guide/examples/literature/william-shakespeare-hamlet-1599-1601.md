Prepare to delve into the richly complex world of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, one of the most influential works in English literature. With its iconic characters and timeless themes of power, revenge, morality, and madness, Hamlet continues to captivate audiences centuries after its creation.

To navigate the intricacies of this monumental work, we will create and explore semantic networks, providing a unique lens through which to view and understand Hamlet.

Through these semantic networks, we'll uncover the deep interconnections between the play's characters, themes, and motifs, illuminating the layered narrative and providing fresh insights into this enduring classic. Join us on this enlightening journey as we explore Hamlet in a way you've never seen before, brought to life through the power of Hellixia's semantic analysis.

### Workflow for Creating a Semantic Network

* Start by creating the node "Hamlet". &#x20;
* Use the **Dimension Elicitor**, employing a broad array of keywords like "Developments", "Ideas", "Perspectives", "Milestones", and many more, to conduct an exhaustive analysis of the play (see the keywords that are listed in the **Class Editor** below).&#x20;

* Inspect the dimensions returned by Hellixia and eliminate any that seem superfluous or unrelated to your analysis. Next, disregard the "Hamlet" node and run the **Embedding Generator** on all remaining nodes to apprehend the semantic associations of their names and comments.
* Use the **Maximum Weight Spanning Tree** algorithm to generate a semantic network.&#x20;
* Change node styles to **Badges** to ensure each node's comment is visible. Then, apply the **Dynamic Grid Layout** to position the nodes on your graph; remember that this algorithm is not deterministic, and its orientation—vertical, horizontal, or mixed—is random. You might need to execute this layout several times to obtain an arrangement that aligns with your taste.
* Switch over to **Validation Mode** and select **Skeleton View**. Since your network doesn't represent causal relations, **Skeleton View** will maintain only node connections without indicating a direction.

### Workflow for Node Force Analysis

* Return to **Modeling Mode** and alter the node styles to **Discs**.&#x20;
* Use the **Symmetric Layout** and switch to **Validation Mode** to run a **Node Force** analysis.

### Workflow for Creating the Hierarchical Semantic Network

* Execute **Variable Clustering**: This operation will categorize analogous variables based on their semantic relationships.

* Open the **Class Editor** and run **Class Description Generator** to generate descriptive names for the factors in question. Use the **Export Descriptions** function, and save the newly created descriptions.
* Return to **Modeling Mode** and run **Multiple Clustering** to generate latent variables.&#x20;
* Run the structural learning algorithm **Taboo**. Ensure the "**Delete Unfixed Arcs**" option is enabled.
* Use the descriptions you exported earlier as a **Dictionary** to rename the latent variables you've created.
* Switch to **Validation** and run **Node Force**.

* Given the size of this network, we can focus on the upper level of the hierarchical network. Below is the **Node Force** analysis on these factors only, i.e., excluding all manifest variables before the analysis.&#x20;
