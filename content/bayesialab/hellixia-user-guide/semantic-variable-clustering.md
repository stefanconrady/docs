# Semantic Variable Clustering

### Context

* Semantic Variable Clustering groups nodes based on the semantics of their Node Names.&#x20;

### Usage & Example

* For this example, we use a list of 49 positive character traits.
* All character traits are represented by nodes in an unconnected Bayesian network.
* The nodes are named after character traits; no other information is available, e.g., in the Node Long Names or the Node Comments.

* Select all nodes you wish to cluster.
* To start the Semantic Variable Clustering, select `Main Menu > Hellixia > Semantic Variable Clustering`.

* In the Semantic Variable Clustering window, you can specify the following item:
  * Your Completion Model, which depends on your OpenAI subscription
  * The Context that may apply to the nodes to be clustered
  * The Maximum Number of Clusters allows you to limit how many clusters are generated.
* Clicking OK initiates Hellixia's communication with ChatGPT.
* Upon completing the task, BayesiaLab presents the Semantic Variable Clustering Report in a new window.

* These newly-created clusters are now represented as Classes, indicated by the Classes icon ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184157/BayesiaLab\_Icons/classes\_dqut6d.svg).
