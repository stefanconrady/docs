### Overview

In the realm of Bayesian Belief Networks, integrating advanced tools can profoundly enhance the modeling, understanding, and interpretation of complex systems. This presentation introduces Hellixia, BayesiaLab's cutting-edge subject matter assistant powered by ChatGPT, as a game-changing tool in this domain.

Discover how Hellixia assists users in identifying pertinent dimensions/nodes within any problem domain. Beyond identification, we delve into exploiting the Independence of Causal Influence principle. This pivotal concept provides a strategic avenue for model simplification, resulting in expedited model-building phases.

The presentation further explores Hellixia's capability to generate embeddings, enabling the discovery of semantic relationships between nodes and facilitating the seamless creation of semantic networks for rapid domain comprehension.

Finally, we'll explore how Hellixia can assist us in identifying causal relationships between nodes.

To provide a hands-on perspective, attendees will be treated to a live demonstration of these features using BayesiaLab, offering a tangible insight into the transformative potential of Hellixia in Bayesian Belief network modeling.

### About the Instructor

* Dr. Lionel Jouffe is co-founder and CEO of France-based Bayesia S.A.S. Lionel holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Rennes and has worked in Artificial Intelligence since the early 1990s. While working as a Professor/Researcher at ESIEA, Lionel started exploring the potential of Bayesian networks.
* After co-founding Bayesia in 2001, he and his team have been working full-time on the development of BayesiaLab, which has since emerged as the leading software package for knowledge discovery, data mining, and knowledge modeling using Bayesian networks. BayesiaLab enjoys broad acceptance in academic communities, business, and industry.
