# ðŸŽ“ Advanced BayesiaLab Course

### Three-Day Advanced BayesiaLab Course

New course dates to be announced.

Building on the foundation laid in the Introductory BayesiaLab Course, we introduce the Advanced BayesiaLab Course for those ready to delve even deeper.

With this immersive experience, you can take your BayesiaLab certification to the next level. While the introductory course provided a comprehensive overview of Bayesian network applications, our advanced curriculum dives into the nuances.
