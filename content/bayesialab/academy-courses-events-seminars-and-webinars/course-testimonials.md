* "BayesiaLab is a great tool that is used in my company. So, I joined this training because of my work. I found the training superb and comprehensive, the theoretical part was highly sophisticated and the practical part featured a great diversity of examples. The fact that the training was a virtual reality session turned out to be a great experience. Plus, it allows you to have access to the training videos afterwards."\
  **Amel Belounnas, Data Scientist, GRTGaz, Introductory Course (VR Edition), 2020**
* "I thought it was excellent hands-on training with the right mix of theory. Helped me understand and comprehend the possibilities with modern BBNs. I enjoyed the Virtual World too. It would have been hard for me to take this live training without being offered virtually."  \
  **Saurav Kumar, Ph.D., P.E., Assistant Professor, Texas A\&M AgriLife Research and Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Introductory Course (VR Edition), 2020**
* "World-class course in an engaging virtual environment! The instructor's depth of knowledge on the subject matter and the BayesiaLab platform is truly incredible. The course provides a deep but still accessible dive into the theory behind the practice with plenty of practical exercises to re-enforce the concepts and learn the wide variety of tools and workflows possible with BayesiaLab. The Laval Virtual Environment is not just another Zoom meeting - it provides an immersive avatar-based experience in 3D space. For example, the instructor can walk through the virtual classroom, see your screen live (if you choose to share it), and provide assistance with the exercises.  You can also interact with the other students including private and public discussion spaces; even a trip to the beach. By far the best remote learning experience I‚Äôve had."\

  **Nicolas Clerc, Caterpillar, Introductory Course, Amsterdam 2019**
* "This is an exceptional three-day intro to Bayesian networks led by top-drawer faculty. Creating a full-dress structural equation model (SEM) in an hour sounds crazy. Because it's impossible. But not with BayesiaLab's probabilistic structural equation model (PSEM) workflow. If you're in data science and haven't experienced BayesiaLab, it's high time. Peerless supervised and unsupervised learning. BayesiaLab beats the stuffing out of traditional linear and logistic regression. No data? No problem -- use expert elicitation to build, validate and optimize your model. Three days just scratches the surface on this powerful analytical tool."  \
  **Kurt Schulzke, Associate Professor of Accounting & Law, University of North Georgia, Introductory Course, Washington 2019**
* "The BayesiaLab training course covers it all, from probability theory to practical examples of how to use the wide range of features that the program offers. The hands-on learning sessions help to answer not only how to create and use Bayesian networks, but why doing so is a breakthrough approach in virtually any field. Lionel is a great instructor who is always listening to feedback in order to make both the course and BayesiaLab itself the best it can be." \
