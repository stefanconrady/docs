# ðŸŽ“ Advanced BayesiaLab Course

### Three-Day Advanced BayesiaLab Course&#x20;

New course dates to be announced.

Building on the foundation laid in the Introductory BayesiaLab Course, we introduce the Advanced BayesiaLab Course for those ready to delve even deeper.&#x20;

With this immersive experience, you can take your BayesiaLab certification to the next level. While the introductory course provided a comprehensive overview of Bayesian network applications, our advanced curriculum dives into the nuances.&#x20;

### About the Instructor

* Dr. Lionel Jouffe is co-founder and CEO of France-based Bayesia S.A.S. Lionel holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Rennes and has worked in Artificial Intelligence since the early 1990s. While working as a Professor/Researcher at ESIEA, Lionel started exploring the potential of Bayesian networks.
* After co-founding Bayesia in 2001, he and his team have been working full-time on the development of BayesiaLab. Since then, BayesiaLab has emerged as the leading software package for knowledge discovery, data mining, and knowledge modeling using Bayesian networks. It enjoys broad acceptance in academic communities, business, and industry.
