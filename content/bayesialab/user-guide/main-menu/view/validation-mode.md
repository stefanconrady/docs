# Validation Mode

### Context&#x20;

* In Validation Mode, you can perform network validation, simulation, and analysis.
* In Validation Mode, both the Graph Panel and the Monitor Panel are displayed in the Graph Window.
* The Graph Window can only be in one of two possible modes, i.e., [Modeling Mode](modeling-mode.md) and [Validation Mode](validation-mode.md).

### Usage&#x20;

* There are several ways to switch to Validation Mode:
  * Click ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184241/BayesiaLab\_Icons/Validation-Mode-Icon\_ttnspc.svg) in the lower-left corner of the Graph Panel.
  * Press the shortcut `F5`.
  * Select `Main Menu > View > Validation Mode`.

{% hint style="info" %}
In any workflow with BayesiaLab, switching between [Modeling Mode](modeling-mode.md) and [Validation Mode](validation-mode.md) is very frequent. Hence, we highly recommend that new users start using the `F4` and `F5` shortcuts straight away.
