# Modeling Mode

### Context&#x20;

* In Modeling Mode, you can conduct all modeling activities, such as learning and editing network graphs.
* In Modeling Mode, only the Graph Panel is visible and accessible inside the Graph Window, i.e., the Graph Panel fills the Graph Window entirely.
* The Graph Window can only be in one of two possible modes, i.e., [Modeling Mode](modeling-mode.md) and [Validation Mode](validation-mode.md).

### Usage&#x20;

* There are several ways to switch to Modeling Mode:
  * Click ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvr3obmlj/image/upload/v1686184233/BayesiaLab\_Icons/Modeling-Mode-Icon\_s6tz0u.svg) in the lower-left corner of the Graph Panel.
  * Press the shortcut `F4`.
  * Select `Main Menu > View > Modeling Mode`.

{% hint style="info" %}
In any workflow with BayesiaLab, switching between [Modeling Mode](modeling-mode.md) and [Validation Mode](validation-mode.md) is very frequent. Hence, we highly recommend that new users start using the `F4` and `F5` shortcuts straight away.
