# Save

* Saves the Bayesian network in the active Graph Window using the XBL format.
* By default, any dataset associated with the Bayesian network and any [Evidence Scenario Files](../data/evidence-scenario-file/) will be saved in the same XBL file so that they can be jointly loaded again later.&#x20;
* You can edit these default settings under `Main Menu > Window > Prefences > Data`.
* If the Bayesian network has a Junction Tree, it will be also automatically saved in the same file. &#x20;
