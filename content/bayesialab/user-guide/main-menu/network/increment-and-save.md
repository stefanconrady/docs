# Increment & Save

* This command saves the current Bayesian network in a new file, adding an iteration number in parentheses to the current file name as a suffix.&#x20;
* If your current network is named Graph.xbl, the Increment & Save function will save it as Graph(2).xbl and not overwrite the original Graph.xbl file.
* With each further iteration of Increment & Save, the counter in the suffix will increase by 1 unit, i.e., Graph(3).xbl, Graph(4).xbl, etc.
* This is a helpful function for maintaining a history when developing a model, allowing you to revert to an earlier version when necessary.
