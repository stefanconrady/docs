# Network Report

### Context&#x20;

* The Network Report is a very comprehensive documentation of the network in the active Graph Window.
* It includes statistics about the network structure as a whole, plus details for each node, such as the Node States, the Conditional Probability Tables, and equations.
* As such, it presents all qualitative and quantitative knowledge contained in the network as a long, tabular report.
* To some extent, you could recreate the network from all these details.

### Usage&#x20;

* Select `Main Menu > Network > Reports > Network` to create the Network Report.
* The report can be quite substantial, depending on your network's size and complexity.
* The following screenshot only shows the top portion of a much longer report:

* For a thorough offline analysis, you may want to save the Network Report as an HTML file, which you can then open as a spreadsheet in Excel.
