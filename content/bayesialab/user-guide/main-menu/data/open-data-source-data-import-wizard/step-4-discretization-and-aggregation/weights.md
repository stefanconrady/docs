# Weights

### Context

* This screen is only available if you designated a Weight variable in [Step 2 â€” Definition of Variable Types](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/data-import-wizard-definition-variable-types).

### Usage

* Click on that Weight variable in the Data panel, and the Normalize Weights checkbox appears as the only option on the screen.

* You need to determine whether to apply Normalize Weights or not:
  * If yes, the Weights will be normalized so that the total number of cases considered by BayesiaLab for machine learning is equal to the actual number of samples in the dataset.
  * If no, the Weight variable will be treated as representing the actual number of observed cases. So, a weight of 10 for one observation would be treated and counted like ten instances of that same observation. As a result, the total number of cases considered by BayesiaLab would correspond to the population from which the weight was calculated.&#x20;
  *   This example illustrates the situation for a survey consisting of 10 observations:\


      | Observation No. | Weight | Normalized Weight |
      | --------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
      | 1               | 10     | 1.0               |
      | 2               | 12     | 1.2               |
      | 3               | 8      | 0.8               |
      | 4               | 9      | 0.9               |
      | 5               | 11     | 1.1               |
      | 6               | 13     | 1.3               |
      | 7               | 7      | 0.7               |
      | 8               | 4      | 0.4               |
      | 9               | 15     | 1.5               |
      | 10              | 11     | 1.1               |
      | Sum             | 100    | 10                |
  * If you do not normalize, BayesiaLab would consider a sample of 100 for learning purposes and presumably find spurious relationships. This "over-counting" by a factor of 10 has the same effect as reducing the [Structural Coefficient](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/structural-coefficient-2392480) to 0.1.
  * If you normalize, BayesiaLab considers the correct proportions of the weighted samples but still only considers ten observations in total for learning purposes.

If you have specified a Weight variable, it will be taken into account in the Discretization and Aggregation algorithms.
