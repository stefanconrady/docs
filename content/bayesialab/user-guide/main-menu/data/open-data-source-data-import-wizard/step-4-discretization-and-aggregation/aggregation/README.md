# Aggregation

Unlike the Discretization step, which is mandatory for Continuous variables, Aggregation is optional for Discrete variables.

Note that an analogous function, Generate Aggregations, is also available for Discrete nodes in the States tab of the Node Editor.

This function is useful when dealing with a large number of values in a Discrete variable. Once imported, the large number of resulting Node States would make it difficult to discover any relationships with that node.

The Aggregation function in the Data Import Wizard is available for single Discrete variables and for multiple Discrete variables.

Please see the usage instructions and examples in the corresponding sub-topics:

* Aggregation of Single Variable
* Aggregation of Multiple Variables
