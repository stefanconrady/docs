# K-Means

### Context

* K-Means is one of the [Automatic Discretization](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/data-import-wizard-discretization-automatic-discretization) algorithms for Continuous variables in [Step 4 â€” Discretization and Aggregation](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/data-import-wizard-discretization-aggregation) of the [Data Import Wizard](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/open-data-source).

### Algorithm Details & Recommendations

* The K-Means algorithm is based on the classical K-Means data clustering algorithm but uses only one dimension, which is the to-be-discretized variable.&#x20;
* K-Means returns a discretization that directly depends on the Probability Density Function of the variable.
* More specifically, it employs the Expectation-Maximization algorithm with the following steps:
  1. Initialization: random creation of K centers
  2. Expectation: each point is associated with the closest center
  3. Maximization: each center position is computed as the barycenter of its associated points
* Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence is reached.
* Based on the centers K, the discretization thresholds are defined as:

$$
{T_i} = \frac{{{K_i} + {K_{i + 1}}}}{2}\
$$

* The following figure illustrates how the algorithm works with K=3.

* For example, applying a three-bin K-Means Discretization to a normally distributed variable would create a central bin representing 50% of the data points and one bin of 25% each for the distribution's tails.
* Without a Target variable, or if little else is known about the variation domain and distribution of the Continuous variables, K-Means is recommended as the default method.
