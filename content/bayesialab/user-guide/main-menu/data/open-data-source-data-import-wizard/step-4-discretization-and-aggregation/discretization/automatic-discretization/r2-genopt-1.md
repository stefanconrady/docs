# R2-GenOpt\*

### Context

* **R2-GenOpt\*** is one of the [Automatic Discretization](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/data-import-wizard-discretization-automatic-discretization) algorithms for Continuous variables in [Step 4 â€” Discretization and Aggregation](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/data-import-wizard-discretization-aggregation) of the [Data Import Wizard](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/open-data-source).
* **R2-GenOpt\*** is a modified version of R2-GenOpt and uses a specific MDL score to choose the number of bins.&#x20;

### Algorithm Details & Recommendations

With 100 observations, even though we selected 8 bins, only 3 were created for the variable _8- Wrist girth_.

With 1,500 observations, even though we selected 10 bins, only 5 have been created for _AGN,_ and 6 for _ALL_.
