# Step 5 â€” Import Report

The Import Report is the fifth and final step of the Data Import Wizard.

### Workflow

* After you click Finish in [Step 4](step-4-discretization-and-aggregation/) of the Data Import Wizard, two progress bars inform you about the status:
  * Data Discretization:\

  * Missing Values Estimation:\

* Depending on the size of your dataset, the selected discretization algorithms, and the number of Missing Values, this may take anywhere from a fraction of a second to several minutes.
* Once completed, BayesiaLab opens up a new [Graph Window](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/graph-windows) with all imported variables now represented as nodes.
* At the same time, a prompt appears, offering you the Import Report.

* Note that this report is entirely optional. So whether you display it or not does not affect the completion of the [Data Import Wizard](./).
* Click Yes to bring up the Import Report window.

* The first column displays the names of the imported variables.
* The second column displays the type associated with each variable.
  * For a Weight variable, no further information is available or provided.
  * For a Learn/Test variable, the association with BayesiaLab's Learn and Test labels is shown, plus the corresponding number of cases.
* The third column shows all States of each variable, if applicable.
* The right part of the report depends on the variable type:
  * Discrete Variables:
    * The report shows each state and, adjacent to it, any aggregations that were performed. Furthermore, the color of the rightmost cell in the row highlights that an aggregation took place.&#x20;
  * Continuous Variables:
    * The names of the discretized states are shown.
    * The next two columns to the right report the lower and upper thresholds for each interval.
    * The rightmost column is colored according to the discretization algorithm used.
    * Asked/Obtained indicates the requested discretization algorithm versus the one that was used as the fallback option.
* Note that you can save this Import Report as an HTML file, so you can subsequently open the fully-formatted report in Excel or any other spreadsheet software.
