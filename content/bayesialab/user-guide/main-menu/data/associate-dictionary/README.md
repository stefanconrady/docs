# Associate Dictionary

### **Context** <a href="#data-associatedictionary49003347" id="data-associatedictionary49003347"></a>

Dictionaries offer a convenient way to manage a large set of properties related to a Bayesian network using text files with a human-readable syntax.

Dictionaries are plain text files that can be opened and edited outside of BayesiaLab in any text editor.

Using Dictionaries, you can export the properties of a given network or associate properties that you previously saved.

Dictionaries are specific to the elements of a Bayesian network, e.g., Arcs, Nodes, and States and their respective properties.

### Usage

To associate a Dictionary for Arc properties, select

`Main Menu > Data > Associate Dictionary > Arc >`

and then select the property from the submenu:

As indicated by the syntax, the name of the node, class or state in the text file cannot contain equal, space or tab characters. If the node names contain such characters in the networks, those characters must be written with a {color} (backslash) character before in the text file: for example the node named Visit Asia will be written Visit\ Asia in the file.

In order to specifically differenciate a nam which is the same for a classe, a node or a state, you must add at the end of the name the suffix "c" for a class, "n" for a node and "s" for a state.

If your network contains non-ASCII characters, you must save your own dictionaries with UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding. For example, in MS Excel, choose "save as" and select "Text Unicode (\*.txt)" as type of file. In Notepad, choose "save as" and select "UTF-8" as encoding. If your file contains only ASCII character you can let the default encoding (depending on the platform) but it is strongly encouraged to use UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding in order to create dictionary files that doesn't depend on the user's platform. So, for example, a chinese dictionary can be read by a german without any problem whatever the used platforms are. If you are not sure how to save a file with UTF-8 encoding, you should export a dictionary with BayesiaLab, modify and save it (with any text editor) and load it in BayesiaLab.
