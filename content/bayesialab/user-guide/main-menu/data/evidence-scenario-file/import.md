# Import

A saved Evidence Scenario File can be reimported into the network from where it originated (e.g., after external modification, see [Evidence Scenario File Syntax](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/evidence-scenario-file-syntax)) or it can be loaded into an entirely different network file.

* `Main Menu > Data > Evidence Scenario File > Associate`.
* If the newly-associated Evidence Scenario File contains incompatible content, e.g., nonexistent nodes in the network, BayesiaLab shows a corresponding error message:

![](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/resources/Storage/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/User-Guide/Menus/Data/Evidence-Scenario-File/AssociateEvidenceScenarioFileNonexistentError.png)

* However, the remaining, compatible content will be available in the now-attached Evidence Scenario File.
