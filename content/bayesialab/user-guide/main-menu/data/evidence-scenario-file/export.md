# Export

When working with multiple networks that contain the same nodes, or at least some of the same nodes, it can be useful to share an Evidence Scenario File between them as well.&#x20;

For that purpose, you can export an Evidence Scenario File and subsequently associate it with another network or be used with a WebSimulator.

* Main Menu > Data > Evidence Scenario File > Export.
* Then choose a file name and click Save.
* The Evidence Scenario File is now saved in a human-readable and easily editable text format.
* This allows you to modify the Evidence Scenario File with a text editor, e.g., to add a number of new Evidence Scenarios.

Please see the sub-topic [Evidence Scenario File Syntax](https://bayesia.clickhelp.co/articles/bayesialab-knowledge-hub/evidence-scenario-file-syntax) for a detailed discussion of the format.
